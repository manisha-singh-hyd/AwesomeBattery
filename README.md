# AwesomeBattery

A macOS menu bar application that provides visual battery alerts through screen borders.

## Features

- Menu bar battery percentage indicator
- Visual border alerts when battery is low
- Configurable alert and critical battery thresholds
- Automatic border width adjustment based on screen size

## How It Works

The app monitors your MacBook's battery level and provides visual feedback through colored borders around your screen(s):

### Alert State (11%-20% by default)
- Shows a red border around all screens
- Border width gradually increases as battery level drops
- Maximum border width is 1.6% of the smallest screen dimension

### Critical State (10% and below by default)
- Border starts flashing to grab attention
- Uses maximum border width (1.6% of smallest screen dimension)
- Shows "CHARGE NOW" warning text when battery drops below half of critical threshold (5%)

### Normal State (Above 20% by default)
- No border shown
- Battery percentage visible in menu bar

### Charging State
- All alerts are cleared
- Border disappears
- Battery percentage shows charging indicator in menu bar
